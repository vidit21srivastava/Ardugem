A Walk in the park.


This game is a 3D implementation of popular platform games such as Subway Surfers and Temple Run.

You are a player who has to jump over water puddles and dodge trees in order to navigate through the game.
There are oranges placed over each puddle, if you jump over these puddle, you will be able to eat the orange.
Eating oranges fetches eatra points score.

To start the game, you have to shake the console sideways.
This game is best played keeping the console (breadboard) flat.
Your roll input will determine the horizontal movement on the screen.
If you change pitch input, ie. if you tilt the breadboard up and down, you can see the horizon level change as well. This adds the 3-D feel to the game.
A quick jerk twist will make your player jump. This jump is a parabolic approximation.

A player needs to jump at the right time in order to avoid puddles and get bonus scores.

If you hit a puddle or a tree, the game stops, and gives out your final score, press the reset button on the arduino to restart the game.


All the pixel assignment in this game are dynamic, this gives the game a continious feel.
